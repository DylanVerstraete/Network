######Genetics
Geneticly my admixture is Ashkenazi, Italian, Roman, Balkan, French, German, English, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Iranian. With small bits of modern African admixture. Genetically I match mainly Italian, Balkan, Ashkenazi & Eastern European individuals.
######Notable Genetic Traits
I have AA on SNP rs4680 which about 15% or less of the population has. 85% has AG or GG. With AA comes "Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions".
######What do you consider yourself?
I'm a developer & designer by trade.

I share views with Ayn Rand, a capitalist to my core. I tend to vote conservative, none the less I incorporate some left leaning views.
######What I'm working on
My main focus is building ultra scalable real time self constructing web applications. Built on a proprietary software I call Menrvah. I refuse to use most existing software as they are not built for what is over the horizon.
######What Technologies Does This site use
RehtinkDB, NodeJS, Acid, Lucy, a modified version of Ractive & Menrvah.
######What is Menrvah
Menrvah is a platform for delivering on demand self constructing web applications. To give you a visual idea. Imagine walking on a bridge that is being built as you walk in real time. It's a platform for the future.
