1) Client requests stream initialization
2) Server responds with crypto params
3) Client requests stream start therefore verifying IP origin
4) Server creates Stream


Server sends payloads with chunk, timestamp, and md5 checksum
  - The timestamp is used to estimate latency with size to later check if more packets have been lost
  - FPs can also be used in this algorithm to increase estimation accuracy based on network route
If a chunk is missed it may be re-requested from the server



Need to make sure we can create a certificate with the new hash setup using Blake2b
